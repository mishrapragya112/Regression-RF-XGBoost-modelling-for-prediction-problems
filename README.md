# Salary Prediction Project
## Overview
This project aims to predict salaries based on the number of years of experience using various regression techniques. The dataset used is Salary Data.csv, which contains two columns: Experience Years and Salary.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the following link: Salary Data.csv.

## Objectives
Train different regression models on the dataset.
Evaluate and compare the performance of these models.
Identify the best-performing model for salary prediction.
Models Used
Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
XGBoost Regression
Steps to Follow
Import Libraries and Data:

## Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Load the dataset.
Data Preparation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Train each regression model on the training set.

## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Visualization:

Create plots to visualize the actual vs. predicted salaries.
Plot residuals to analyze model errors.
Compare the performance of all models using bar charts.

## Conclusion:

Based on the evaluation metrics, identify the best-performing model.
Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

# Conclusion
After comparing the performance of all models, the Random Forest Regression model was found to be the best-performing model for predicting salaries based on the experience level, with the lowest MAPE, MAE, and MSE.
